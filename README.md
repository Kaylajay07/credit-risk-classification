# credit-risk-classification

The purpose of this analysis is to use historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. • Accuracy score: 0.99 • Precision: Healthy loan: 1.00, High-risk loan: 0.85 • Recall: Healthy loan: 0.99, High-risk loan: 0.91

The machine learning model performs well and I would recommend the company to use the model. The precision for healthy loans is 100%, which means it always correctly predicts if a loan is healthy. Recall for healthy loans is also at 99% which suggests it can effectively identify healthy loans in the dataset. The precision for high-risk loans is 85% which is not as high as it is for healthy loans but is still promising, in that it predicts high risk loans correctly 85% of the time. The recall on high-risk loans is 91% which means the model does a good job at identifying a high proportion of actual high-risk loans.
